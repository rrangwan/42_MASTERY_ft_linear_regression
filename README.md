# 42_MASTERY_ft_linear_regression
This project takes a simple CSV table of mileage and price data for used cars and produces:<br>
A. Estimated price of a used car based on the model: Theta0 + (mileage)*Theta1<br>
B. Iteratively calculates Theta0 and Theta1 values using gradient descent<br>
C. Produces graphs to depict the data and regression model<br><br>

Usage 

./python3 A_estimate_price.py <br>
(The regression model is run, initially the result is 0 because, the thetas need to be calibrated.)
<br>

./python3 B_linear_regression.py <br>
(Theta0 and Theta1 which are intercept and coefficient respectively of the regression model, are set by this program interatively using the gradient descent model.)<br>

./python3 C_bonus.py <br>
(Scatter graph of the data and the regression line are plotted.)<br>
These plots are saved in the directory plots\
<br><br>
